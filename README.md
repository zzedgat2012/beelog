# Beelog - Logística inteligente.

For skill practice, I am recreating Beelog's website in pure HTML/SCSS/JS. </br>

The technologies used in this project are:

    HTML
    SCSS
    JS
    SQLite

The site contains five pages:

    Home (Main Page)
    Empresa
    Usuário
    Entregador
    Blog (Dynamic Page)

My goal here is to explore CSS Grid for responsiveness, routing with javascript, and basic usage of DB Systems with SQLite.
